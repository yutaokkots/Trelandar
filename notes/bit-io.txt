Connection between Prisma ORM and Bit.io database

There are two things that need to be done in order for bit.io to work with Prisma.

1. Database names must be formatted as username.dbname rather than username/dbname. bit.io supports a number of different separator characters in the database name because different clients have different requirements around permissible characters in database names.

2. You have to create a second database on bit.io to use as a "shadow database." By default, this is done automaticallyâ€”a shadow database is created, used, and deleted. However, most cloud database providers don't allow use of the CREATE DATABASE, so a shadow database must be created explicitly. See the prisma docs for details.

change to: 

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username123:xxxxxxxxxxxxXXxxXXXxxxxXXXxxxXX.bit.io:5432/username123.trelandar

2) create new database in bit.io to serve as the shadow database
